QUIZ 3

List

The object [1e-10,(1,2),"BGP",] is a List.

90.0

The code (grades+grades)/2 returns 90.0.

['GT-AG', 'GC-AG']

splice_site_pairs[:-1] returns ['GT-AG', 'GC-AG'].

L.append(e)

To add a new element e to a list L, we use the command L.append(e).

Error

The code t.append(('A','C','G','T')) will result in an error because tuples don't have an append method.

't'

The print function in the given code will output 't'.

del dna_counts['a']

To delete an entry with the key 'a' from the dictionary, we use the command del dna_counts['a'].

dna_counts={'t':dna.count('t'),'c':dna.count('c'),'g':dna.count('g'),'a':dna.count('a')}
max_freq=sorted(dna_counts.values())[-1]

This code will find the frequency of the most frequent character in the string dna.

All elements common between lists L1 and L2 without duplicates

L3 = list(set(L1)&set(L2)) contains all elements common between lists L1 and L2 without duplicates.

QUIZ 4


This is the correct negation of the original expression. It uses De Morgan's laws to negate the original compound condition.

if fold is 2

The code will print 'condition B' only when fold is exactly 2. For any other value, one of the other conditions will be true.

11

The loop will execute 11 times. Starting from 1, doubling each time: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024. The next doubling would exceed 2048, so it stops after 11 iterations.

1, -2, -5, -8, -11, -14, -17, -20



All three changes are needed to correctly generate all non-empty substrings.

C only

Only option C correctly implements the equivalent while loop version of the original for loop.

Change line3 to be:
if elem in L2 and elem not in L3:

This change ensures that only common elements are added to L3, without duplicates.

The value of the result variable is the same, but the variable d is different.

Both versions correctly compute the result, but they populate the dictionary d differently.

For no value

The conditions for printing 'very big' are never reached due to the first if statement.

2

The loop breaks when i becomes 2, which is the first even number encountered
